  The core multiplayer movement system supports Client Authoritative and Server
  Authoritative movement. The default movement networking mode is Client
  Authoritative.

# Character Movement Networking

### Client Authoritative

The client controls their own character and reports their position and state the server. The server sends the state information to all observers.  This is the default networking mode.

### Server Authoritative

The client sends inputs to the server and predicts what will happen. The server runs the inputs, and sends the correct results back to the client and all observers. If the servers result is different than the client, the client will replay all predicted inputs with the correct data.&#x20;

This is an advanced feature with strict requirements and will significantly increase the complexity of any movement and physics related game mechanics. For more information read [Server Authoritative Movement](server-authoritative-movement/).
