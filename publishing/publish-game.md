# Publish Game

{% hint style="warning" %}
Simplified publishing only works when signed in with Google. If you don't sign in with Google you can [publish using an API key](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Ob5dDteJHkKChzdNkVaS/s/IbaXflSJA8L9N9yOx089/~/changes/322/other/publishing-with-key).

First you will need to register your game:

1. Go to [create.airship.gg](https://create.airship.gg/) and sign up with Google.
2. Click "Create" to make an organization. You can make more organizations in the future.
3. Once you have made your organization click "Create Game" and give it a name

{% endhint %}

### Play your game

Once your game is live you will see a message in your console with a link to play your game on Steam. By default your game is [unlisted](create-dashboard-game-cms/game-visibility.md), meaning you can send this link to friends and play together. Congrats!
