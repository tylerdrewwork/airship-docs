# Voxel World Getting Started

## Creating a Voxel World

VoxelWorld is a component that you will place on a GameObject. To have a Voxel World you will need several components.

* Voxel World - This is the main component that provides the main editor tools for creating a voxel world
* Voxel Blocks - Points to the data for your voxels
* Voxel World Networker - Handles syncing the voxels from server to clients
* Network Identity - Standard ID component for any networked object

{% hint style="info" %}
VoxelWorldNetworker and NetworkIdentity are both only needed if this is a networked voxel world. If you just want to draw something locally they are not needed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Saving the Data

The world data is saved into an object in your project called a WorldSaveFile. In your VoxelWorld component you can select the save file you want, load, and save edits.&#x20;

You can create a new save file in the project by right clicking and choosing:\
`Create/Airship/VoxelWorld/VoxelWorldSaveFile`



## Drawing Blocks

To edit blocks, click the Open Editor button on the VoxelWorld component. This opens a window that you should dock somewhere convenient. The editor lets you switch between voxel worlds, select block types, and access the tools panel.

Tools will show up in your scene view for extra functionality

Be sure to save your work after you are done editing!&#x20;
